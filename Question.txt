🧪 SDP Open Book Examination
Project Option: Blog Platform (Frontend Only)

Duration: 5 Hours (Development)
Evaluation: 2:00 – 4:00 PM (Demo + GitHub Review)
Difficulty: Medium → Moderate Advanced (MCA Level)
Backend: ❌ Not Allowed (Use Mock APIs only)

📌 Problem Statement

Design and implement a Blog Platform Single Page Application (SPA) using React.

The application must allow users to:
